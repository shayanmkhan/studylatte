# StudyLatte
## Description
This iOS app was developed using XCode as a final team project for a course in Mobile Computing.

The primary function of the app is to display a list of nearby coffee shops (also viewable as a map) and display whether each shop has open seats available. It also allows the user to maintain a list of favorite coffee shops, whose status may be accessed quickly.

The third-party APIs used in the development of this project include Facebook SDK (for user account management), Apple's CoreLocation framework (for location services), and Apple MapKit (for building the map interface).

## How to Use
The main Swift code files can be viewed in the "studylattefinal" folder. Also, the app can be downloaded and imported into XCode, and run using an iPhone simulator.
